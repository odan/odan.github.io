I would say that I was a very loyal and excessive Google user. 

But lately I became more and more frustrated with the usability of Gmail, Calendar and Notes. 

Therefore I decided to search for alternatives. 

After a lot of consideration I decided to switch to the following alternatives:

* Gmail -> [Outlook.com](https://outlook.com)
* Calendar -> [Calendar Outlook.com](https://office.live.com/start/Calendar.aspx)
* Notes and Todos -> [OneNote](https://www.onenote.com/hrd) (very cool)
* Google Drive -> [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com) (15 GB free)
* Google Search -> No change, [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) is a free alternative
* Google Plus -> [Twitter](https://twitter.com/)
* Blogger -> [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/)
* YouTube -> No change
* Mobile (Android) -> No change
* Google Maps -> No change, [Bing Maps](https://www.bing.com/maps) is a free alternative
* Chrome browser -> No change, [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home) is a free alternative

## Make a Backup!

Use [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout) to backup your emails and most of the files stored in your google account.

**Warning**: Your [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/) will **not be included in the backup**! Just export the Slides to PowerPoint.

## Moving Gmail to Outlook.com

I moved all my Gmail emails with Outlook for Windows by moving all directories via IMAP to the new Outlook mailbox. 

By default IMAP is disabled in Gmail. To enable IMAP you have to [enable the IMAP access for external applications](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7126229?hl=en).

## Moving the Google Calendar to the Outlook.com Calendar

I just created my calendar events manually.

But you can also [export your Google calendar](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37111?hl=en) to vCalendar (*.ics) files and [import it into your Outlook calendar](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/import-or-subscribe-to-a-calendar-in-outlook-com-cff1429c-5af6-41ec-a5b4-74f2c278e98c).

Clear all of the events on your calendar and empty the Google Calendar Recycle Bin.

## Moving Notes to OneNote

I exported my [Google notes](https://keep.google.com/) manually into Google Docs and then copy/pasted the content from the 
Google Doc to OneNote. 

Delete the generated Google Docs and empty the Google Keep Recycle Bin.

## Moving Google Drive to OneDrive

Install the [OneDrive client](https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-US/download/) on your PC and just move all the files out of the Google Drive directory.

Don't for forget to [empty your trash](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2375102?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en).
